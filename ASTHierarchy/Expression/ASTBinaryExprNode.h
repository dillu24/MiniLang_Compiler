/**
 * This is the ASTBinaryExprNode class and is used to encode an expression that has an operator with operands on
 * the left hand side and on the right hand side appended to it. Note that in this implementation the Operators class
 * is not a node ,but a type in order to store the operator. Thus the children of this node are the expression on the
 * left hand side and the expression on the right hand side. This is a concrete class and is a child of the ASTExprNode,
 * so it must implement the accept method
