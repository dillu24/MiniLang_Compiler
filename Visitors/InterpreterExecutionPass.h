/**
 * This class is used to create an interpreter execution pass , this class is a child of Visitor , thus it must implement
 * all the virtual methods in the interface class. The purpose of this class is so that the parse tree created by the predictive
 * parser , is used so that the program can be executed . Note that this class was implemented in a way such that first the program
 * is checked if it is valid or not , since if it is not valid , then the program cannot be evaluated . Also this made it
 * easier to focus more on the evaluation , rather than focusing on reporting errors,since this has already been done.
