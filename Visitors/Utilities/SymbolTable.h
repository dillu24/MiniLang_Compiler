/**
 * This class is used to encode the Symbol Table that is used whenever a scoped is opened to store variables that are
 * related with that scope. Thus this class represents one table entry for a particular scope. A scope has a multimap
 * that stores the variable's and function's names which are mapped to an instance of a type binder. A multimap is used
 * instead of a map because , in this language it was assumed that we can have a function and a variable with the same
 * name , however we cannot have 2 functions and 2 variables with the same name .
