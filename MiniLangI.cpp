/**
 * This class encodes the REPL , where an instance of the lexer,parser and interpreter executor is kept. This main
 * method keeps on looping until the user enters #exit . Whenever the user enters #load , the program asks the user
 * for the text file he wants to input to the compiler ,it is important that the source code is in
 * CompilersAssignment/TestPrograms. Also if the user enters #st , the current state of the symbol table is displayed,
 * where the name of the identifier next to the nature of the identifier are displayed . If the user enters a valid
 * statement , that is tokenized , the parse tree is created for that statement , and the semantic analyzer and executor
 * are also run until an answer is display . It is important that the lexer restarts from the initial state and the
 * syntax tree is emptied , so that on the next statement we do not execute previously executed statements. Also ,
 * if the user wants to enter large programs he cannot enter them directly in the console , but load them from a text
 * file . This was done this was since it is more practable. Note the interpreter works in a way like the ebnf , for
 * example if 4+5 is entered , this is an invalid statement , since the ebnf specifies that a print ,etc.. must be
 * before it.
